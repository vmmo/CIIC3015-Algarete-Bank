The purpose for this code is to read from the alghistorical.txt and organize
its content based on the zero index of the list, starting off with the O,
this letter represent a new account, W represents withdrawl, D represents 
deposit, and finally B represents bonus. Within which all get a fee for 
being called upon, except for the bonus, which is meant to be a wage added
to the bank accounts that have been with the bank previous to the function
being called. Aside from organizing its content it also takes into account 
the average amount of money in the bank, the person with the most money and
the person with the least amount. Some of the code is organized by the bank 
number which is generated with the letter O, as well as being organized in
alphabetical order as the names are generated. This is all displayed at the
end after running the code.
